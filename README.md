# HelloMapBox

This code worked to display a MapBox map in the DAQRI HUD.

To get it running you need to:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the cloned folder using Unity.
3. Re-import the DAQRI package into Assets/DAQRI (Assets => Import Assets => Custom Package... => Vos_Extension_for_Unity-2.0.18.unitypackage => Open => Import => I Made a Backup. Go Ahead!)
4. Click Mapbox => Configure and enter mapbox access token (you can obtain one at https://www.mapbox.com/install/unity/permission/ )
5. Double-click on "Mapbox Scene" under Assets at the bottom of the screen.
